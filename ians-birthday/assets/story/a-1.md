The Stiltons were all in Geronimo’s office at _The Rodents Gazette_.

“Have you heard about the big new exhibit at the New Mouse City art gallery, The _Mouseum of Modern Art_?” Trap asked.

“Yeah, it’s going to have a very special painting there - the _Mozzarella Lisa_ by Leonardo de Velvetta. It’s the most expensive painting in the world! I heard that all the most famous rodents are going to the grand opening,” said Pandora.

Benjamin nodded his head. “Not only that, but my favourite painter, Van Gouda’s famous painting _Cheesy Night_ will also be shown at the gallery.”

“Well, I guess we should go get my guide book,” said Geronimo. “Can you drive, Thea?”

“Sure! I’ll have to go home first. What are the directions so I can program the GPS of the Metamouse?” asked Thea.
