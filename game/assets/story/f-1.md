Thea pulled the Metamouse up to Stotnose Castle. They all jumped out and ran inside.

“I don’t think anyone’s here,” said Trap.

“We can’t give up yet. There’s got to be a clue here somewhere,” said Geronimo.

Benjamin and Pandora were looking at the stairs. “Look! The railing up the stairs has the same red paw prints!”

They all followed the paw prints up the stairs and came to the library. In the library, there was a door locked with a padlock. The padlock needed a three-number code. The paw prints were all over the door!

“Well, the painting’s probably in there,” said Geronimo.

“In the meantime, let's take a look at all these books! I wonder if there are any comics?” wondered Trap. He pulled a random book off the wall, and a paper fell out.

Thea grabbed the book from Trap. “Look! This book has the same red paint on the spine. What’s on the paper that fell out?”

Geronimo examined the paper. “Hmm... it looks like part of some sort of code. Are there any other books that have that paint on them?”

Pandora started searching the books. “We must need three codes. One for each number in the padlock!”
