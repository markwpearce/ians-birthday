When they arrived at the museum, a security guard pulled them out of the entrance line and whispered, “Geronimo, I’m glad you’re here! One of the paintings in the art show has gone missing!”

“Oh no! Which one?” asked Geronimo.

“_Cheesy Night_, by Vincent Van Gouda.”

“Oh man, that was my favourite!” exclaimed Benjamin.

“What are we going to do?” asked the guard. “The grand opening starts in 5 minutes!”

All of a sudden Sally Ratmousen, Geronimo’s main rival, storms up to the guard and demands, “What’s going on? We want to go in to see the show! Don’t you know all the publicity you’ll get when I report on this exhibit?”

Trap whispered to Geronimo, “Hey, I’ve been taking an art class! I think we could make a copy of the painting real quick, and put it up in the gallery before it opens!”

“I really don’t think that’s a great idea, but it’s all we can do!” said Geronimo.
