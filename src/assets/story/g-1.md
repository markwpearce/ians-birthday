The lock opened with a click! The room on the other side of the door was like a large laboratory or factory. There were lots of large machines all over the room. At the far end of the room, there was a table, and Van Gouda’s most famous painting, Cheesy Night, was sitting on the table.

As Geronimo and his friends burst through the door, they heard a familiar laugh. It was the evil business mouse, Chippy P. Crunchrat! “So you’ve found me, eh, Geronimo?” He pushed a button and a net fell on them all, trapping them, so they wouldn’t move.

“Well, you can’t get away now. As you can see, I have the painting _Cheesy Night_. I’m going to rip it up and add it as a secret ingredient in my newest cheese snack _Van Gouda Bites_. People will pay millions just to get a small piece of this famous painting... I’ll be rich!”

“Oh no! We have to get that painting before he destroys it!” Geronimo was worried.
