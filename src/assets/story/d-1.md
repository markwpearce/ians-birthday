Thea was the first one to the scene of the crime, and quickly put up the fake painting in place of the stolen one, taking the old frame off the wall.

“Whew! I don’t think anyone will notice,” said Benjamin.

“We still have to find out who stole the original,” said Geronimo. “That painting is worth a lot of money, and we need to bring the thief to justice!”

Thea held the broken frame from the original painting in her hands. “Hmm... there’s some red paw prints on the back...”

Benjamin jumped up, whipped out his BenPad and said, “Professor von Volt just installed a new app on this. It can do a chemical analysis of almost any substance.”

He held up his BenPad tablet to the picture frame and it beeped five times. “It says it’s just red paint, but like, some sort of antique paint?”

Geronimo scratched his chin. “They would only use that kind of paint in some fancy, old building.”

Trap spoke up, “Like a church? Or an old hotel, or a theatre...”

Geronimo suddenly remembered something. “Or a castle! Stotnose Castle was just undergoing renovations. I wrote about it in the Rodent’s Gazette! That must be where they took the painting!”

Thea started running out of the museum. “Stotnose Castle is across the river. We’ll take bridge by Grandfather William’s house. To the Metamouse!” Thea exclaimed. “Quick, what are the directions?”
